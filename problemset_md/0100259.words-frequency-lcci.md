Design a method to find the frequency of occurrences of any given word in a book. What if we were running this algorithm multiple times?

You should implement following methods:

- `WordsFrequency(book)` constructor, parameter is a array of strings, representing the book.
- `get(word)` get the frequency of `word` in the book.

**Example:**

<pre>WordsFrequency wordsFrequency = new WordsFrequency({"i", "have", "an", "apple", "he", "have", "a", "pen"});
wordsFrequency.get("you"); //returns 0，"you" is not in the book
wordsFrequency.get("have"); //returns 2，"have" occurs twice in the book
wordsFrequency.get("an"); //returns 1
wordsFrequency.get("apple"); //returns 1
wordsFrequency.get("pen"); //returns 1
</pre>

**Note:**

- `There are only lowercase letters in book[i].`
- `1 <= book.length <= 100000`
- `1 <= book[i].length <= 10`
- `get` function will not be called more than 100000 times.

## 翻译

设计一个方法，找出任意指定单词在一本书中的出现频率。

你的实现应该支持如下操作：

- `WordsFrequency(book)`构造函数，参数为字符串数组构成的一本书
- `get(word)`查询指定单词在书中出现的频率

**示例：**

<pre>WordsFrequency wordsFrequency = new WordsFrequency({"i", "have", "an", "apple", "he", "have", "a", "pen"});
wordsFrequency.get("you"); //返回0，"you"没有出现过
wordsFrequency.get("have"); //返回2，"have"出现2次
wordsFrequency.get("an"); //返回1
wordsFrequency.get("apple"); //返回1
wordsFrequency.get("pen"); //返回1
</pre>

**提示：**

- `book[i]`中只包含小写字母
- `1 <= book.length <= 100000`
- `1 <= book[i].length <= 10`
- `get`函数的调用次数不会超过 100000

### C

```c



typedef struct {

} WordsFrequency;


WordsFrequency* wordsFrequencyCreate(char** book, int bookSize) {

}

int wordsFrequencyGet(WordsFrequency* obj, char* word) {

}

void wordsFrequencyFree(WordsFrequency* obj) {

}

/**
 * Your WordsFrequency struct will be instantiated and called as such:
 * WordsFrequency* obj = wordsFrequencyCreate(book, bookSize);
 * int param_1 = wordsFrequencyGet(obj, word);

 * wordsFrequencyFree(obj);
*/
```

### Go

```golang
type WordsFrequency struct {

}


func Constructor(book []string) WordsFrequency {

}


func (this *WordsFrequency) Get(word string) int {

}


/**
 * Your WordsFrequency object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * obj := Constructor(book);
 * param_1 := obj.Get(word);
 */
```

### Python3

```python
class WordsFrequency:

    def __init__(self, book: List[str]):


    def get(self, word: str) -> int:



# Your WordsFrequency object will be instantiated and called as such:
# obj = WordsFrequency(book)
# param_1 = obj.get(word)
```

### JavaScript

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} book
 */
var WordsFrequency = function (book) {};

/**
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {number}
 */
WordsFrequency.prototype.get = function (word) {};

/**
 * Your WordsFrequency object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * var obj = new WordsFrequency(book)
 * var param_1 = obj.get(word)
 */
```

### Java

```java
class WordsFrequency {

    public WordsFrequency(String[] book) {

    }

    public int get(String word) {

    }
}

/**
 * Your WordsFrequency object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * WordsFrequency obj = new WordsFrequency(book);
 * int param_1 = obj.get(word);
 */
```
