Given an `m x n` 2d `grid` map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return _the number of islands_.

An **island** is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
<strong>Output:</strong> 3
</pre>

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## 翻译

给你一个由  `'1'`（陆地）和 `'0'`（水）组成的的二维网格，请你计算网格中岛屿的数量。

岛屿总是被水包围，并且每座岛屿只能由水平方向和/或竖直方向上相邻的陆地连接形成。

此外，你可以假设该网格的四条边均被水包围。

**示例 1：**

<pre><strong>输入：</strong>grid = [
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
<strong>输出：</strong>1
</pre>

**示例 2：**

<pre><strong>输入：</strong>grid = [
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]
]
<strong>输出：</strong>3
</pre>

**提示：**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 300`
- `grid[i][j]` 的值为 `'0'` 或 `'1'`
