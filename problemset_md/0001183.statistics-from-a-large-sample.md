We sampled integers between `0` and `255`, and stored the results in an array `count`:  `count[k]` is the number of integers we sampled equal to `k`.

Return the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and mode of the sample respectively, as an array of **floating point numbers**.  The mode is guaranteed to be unique.

_(Recall that the median of a sample is:_

- _The middle element, if the elements of the sample were sorted and the number of elements is odd;_
- _The average of the middle two elements, if the elements of the sample were sorted and the number of elements is even.)_

**Example 1:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> count = [0,1,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1.00000,3.00000,2.37500,2.50000,3.00000]
</pre>

**Example 2:**

<pre><strong>Input:</strong> count = [0,4,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
<strong>Output:</strong> [1.00000,4.00000,2.18182,2.00000,1.00000]
</pre>

**Constraints:**

1.  `count.length == 256`
2.  `1 <= sum(count) <= 10^9`
3.  The mode of the sample that count represents is unique.
4.  Answers within `10^-5` of the true value will be accepted as correct.

## 翻译

我们对  `0`  到  `255`  之间的整数进行采样，并将结果存储在数组  `count`  中：`count[k]`  就是整数  `k` 的采样个数。

我们以  **浮点数** 数组的形式，分别返回样本的最小值、最大值、平均值、中位数和众数。其中，众数是保证唯一的。

我们先来回顾一下中位数的知识：

- 如果样本中的元素有序，并且元素数量为奇数时，中位数为最中间的那个元素；
- 如果样本中的元素有序，并且元素数量为偶数时，中位数为中间的两个元素的平均值。

**示例 1：**

<pre><strong>输入：</strong>count = [0,1,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
<strong>输出：</strong>[1.00000,3.00000,2.37500,2.50000,3.00000]
